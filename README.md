# MissileCommand
The game of Missile Command.

## How to Play
Start the game by running the executable file `MissileCommand.jar`.

You have three yellow missile launchers at your command, each with a limited supply of red missiles to launch. There are six blue command stations located between the missile launchers that you must protect from the green alien projectiles that are launched down at you. Use your mouse to place the cursor where you want to aim your missile. Press the `left` arrow key to launch a missile from the left-side launcher. Press the `up` arrow key to launch a missile from the middle launcher. Press the `right` arrow key to launch a missile from the right-side launcher. If any of the launchers or command stations are hit by a green alien projectile, the launcher/station will be out of commission. Complete as many levels and rack up as many points as you can before all of your launchers and/or stations are out of commission and the game is over!
